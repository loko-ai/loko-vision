### Loko component for Image Classification



This component allows to perform Transfer Learning to classify images, using Keras pre-trained Neural Networks models. 


It's also possible to classify images using directly Keras pre-trained Neural Network, without having to train your own model. In this case the available labels are the ones of the ImageNet Dataset (you can find the complete list [here](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a))
